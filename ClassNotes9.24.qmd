## More about `group_by` and `summarize`

Let's look at `ggplot::diamonds`, and get some group summaries. Let's start by glimpsing the set and looking at the help file(in console)

```{r}
glimpse(diamonds)
```

How do diamond prices vary by cut and color?

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>% 
  summarize(avg_price = mean(price),
            avg_carat = mean(carat),
            count = n()) %>% # add counts
  gt::gt()
```
The `gt` package allows for a**lot** of customization which we won't cover. Start with `?gt`.

We used `n()` in the last examples. If all you want is counts. there is an easy shortcut.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  count(cut) %>% 
  gt::gt()
```

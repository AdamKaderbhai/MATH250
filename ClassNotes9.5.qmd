## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed). You can also use `include : false` to run the code but not show anything, 'eval : false\` to show but not run the code

```{r}
#|eval: false
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(penguins)
```

## Boxplots

let's get a boxplot showing `bill_len` by `species`.

```{r}
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, aes(y = bill_len,
                     x = species)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

Here two observations are missing let's investigate

By the way, **Never** include interactive commands like `View` and `install.packages` in a Quarto document

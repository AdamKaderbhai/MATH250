Consider the distribution of spam ratings:

```{r}
ggplot(colors, 
       aes(x = spam_prob)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 100)
```

One thing you can try on a distribution like this where values <= 0 aren't possible and where there is a very strong right skew is a log transform. Let's use base 10.

```{r}
ggplot(colors, 
       aes(x = log10(spam_prob))) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 100)
```

Positives of this: the fine differences are more visible and the data is more amenable to statistical methods like the t-test.

Negatives: the axis is transformed so interpretation is harder for readers.

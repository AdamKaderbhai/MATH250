## The t-test

Lets consider penguins' bill lengths

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
mean(penguins$bill_len,
     na.rm = TRUE)
```

A field guide says the averahe length of all penguin bills in this population is 43mm. Is this plausible in light of the data? To start answering this we could make a histogram.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_len)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
